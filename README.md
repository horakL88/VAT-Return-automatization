This is a proof of concept project. Please note that this project is in its early phase so it cannot create a full VAT return and there are mixing of Hungarian and English in template files.

The main goal of the script is to create an XML file that can be imported to the Hungarian Tax Authorities' √ÅNYK application as a finished Hungarian VAT return.

The information is given from a template excel file where information about the company and invoices with the correct tax codes defined in the codes.xlsx file. The script categorizes the invoice data given based on these codes and calculates the correct amounts to be reported.
